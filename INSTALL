Installation Instructions for libPacket
=======================================
Libpacket uses the well-known configuration(autotools) infrastructure.

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If building libpacket from a git checkout you'll need to first run
autoreconf.

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Prerequisites
=============

    * libpcap (tcpdump.org) - optional

    * build essentials for your environment

Configuring and compiling
=========================

./configure [options]

--prefix=

    The prefix to put all installed files under. It defaults to
    /usr/local, so the binaries will go into /usr/local/bin, manpages
    into /usr/local/share/man, etc.

Caveats
=======

    LibPacket is still in the 'alpha' stage of development. The API
    for libpacket is still in flux and liable to changes before its
    iminent release.

    The following is a list of likely API breaking changes for the
    future:

        * Libpacket contexts

            This would allow an user to implement multiple 'instances'
            of libpacket in an application.

        * Further changes to the Packet structure

            Its still unclear what should/should not be push into the
            packet structure. This requires more thorough analysis of 
            memory and cpu time.
